## Portfolio Project 4

Full-Stack Toolkit
Project purpose:

In this project, you'll build a Full-Stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide role-based access to the site's data or other activities based on the dataset.

- address the user persona from my previous projects. https://github.com/annagabain/Mom-Lifehacks#User-Experience-and-User-Interface-Design-UX-and-UI
- includes a calendar, event editing, creating task cards.

## Testing

### Debugging

:lady_beetle: - *Static files weren't included by Heroku after deployment.*

:bulb: - Using WhiteNoise package fixed the issue.

<img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation/static_css_heroku.jpg"> <img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation/static_css_local.jpg">

:lady_beetle: - *Title prepopulated with the first word only*

:mag: {{ title }}

:bulb: Changed to {{ 'title' }} as a string and it worked

:lady_beetle: - *Date Format*

having trouble with the date formats in Django. The html form has dd-mm-yyyy and Django has yyyy-mm-dd.
They somehow communicate innerly to save the date correctly in the database but the problem occurs when I try editing one of my Task, by clicking the yellow edit button for a specific task on my all_tasks.html. 

It **did not prepopulate the date dropdown** and threw an error when trying to submit without chosing the date over again. However, editing inside the admin site worked well (it displayed yyyy-mm-dd).

<img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation/bug-date-admin.jpg"> <img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation/bug-date-admin-2.jpg">

<img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation/bug-date-admin-3.jpg"> <img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation/bug-date-admin-4.jpg">

:mag: - Tried solving by adding this code to settings.py: 

LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-us'

USE_L10N = False

DATE_INPUT_FORMATS = ['%d-%m-%Y']

It did not work


:bulb: - I found a solution:

Changed the date format in my edit function in views.py as following:

...

date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),

Now it prepopulates my field with date as dd-mm-yyyy. The mom_task is then saved without errors.
