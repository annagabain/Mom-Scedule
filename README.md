I am thinking to create an app called Mom Schedule, to address the same user persona as for my previous projects. The app should include a calendar, event editing, (maybe showing meeting locations on google maps) and creating task (to-do) cards.

# Portfolio Project 4
Full-Stack Toolkit
Project purpose:

In this project, you'll build a Full-Stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide role-based access to the site's data or other activities based on the dataset.

## Main Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django
Postgres Relational database
