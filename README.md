### Using Frameworks

Django 
Bootstrap 5

### Using Source code

Some parts of the projects have been created using sections of code from other sources. An example of this is the HTML calendar feature, that was partially taken from a repository: https://github.com/sajib1066/event-calendar , forked and adapted to the Mom Schedule project.

## Testing

### Validators

### Manual Testing

### Automatic Testing - Writing Functions


### Django testing 
#### Test functions
Djangoâ€™s unit tests use a Python standard library module: unittest. This module defines tests using a class-based approach.

tests.py

in terminal:
**python3 manage.py test**

*test_forms.py*

<img width="100%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/test_forms.jpg"> 

python3 manage.py test mom_schedule_app.test_forms

python3 manage.py test mom_schedule_app.test_forms.Test_NewUserForm

python3 manage.py test mom_schedule_app.test_forms.Test_NewUserForm.test_item_email_is_required


#### Coverage

in Terminal:

pip3 install coverage

coverage run --source=mom_schedule_app manage.py test

**coverage report nr. 1**

<img width="70%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/coverage_report_1.jpg"> 


**coverage html**

coverage html
python3 -m http.server

<img width="70%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/coverage_htmlcov.jpg"> 


The coverage report nr.1 showed there are improvements to make in the following tests :

- test_models.py - tested 86%, so 14% was yet to be improved
- test_utils.py - tested 32%, so 68% was yet to be improved
- test_views.py - tested 32%, so 68% was yet to be improved

**test_models.py**

**test_utils.py**

**test_views.py**


**coverage report nr. 2**




### Debugging

:lady_beetle: - *Static files weren't included by Heroku after deployment.*

:bulb: - Using the WhiteNoise package fixed the issue.

*Before*

<img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/static_css_heroku.jpg"> 

*After*

<img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/static_css_local.jpg">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


:lady_beetle: - *Title prepopulated with the first word only*

:mag: {{ title }}

:bulb: Changed to {{ 'title' }} as a string and it worked

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:lady_beetle: - *Date Format*

having trouble with the date formats in Django. The HTML form has dd-mm-yyyy and Django has yyyy-mm-dd.
They somehow communicate to save the date correctly in the database but the problem occurs when I try editing one of my Tasks, by clicking the yellow edit button for a specific task on my all_tasks.html. 

It **did not prepopulate the date dropdown** and threw an error when trying to submit without choosing the date over again. However, editing inside the admin site worked well (it displayed yyyy-mm-dd).

<img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/bug-date-admin.jpg"> <img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/bug-date-admin-2.jpg">

<img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/bug-date-admin-3.jpg"> <img width="50%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/bug-date-admin-4.jpg">

:mag: - Tried solving by adding this code to settings.py: 

LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en-us'

USE_L10N = False

DATE_INPUT_FORMATS = ['%d-%m-%Y']

It did not work


:bulb: - I found a solution:

Changed the date format in my edit function in views.py as follows:

...

date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),

Now it prepopulates my field with the date as dd-mm-yyyy. The mom_task is then saved without errors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:lady_beetle: TestCase Bug
- *Got an error creating the test database: permission denied to create database*


*Before*

<img width="70%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/testing_database_bug.jpg"> 

:mag:  - Checking the current database settings in settings.py

<img width="70%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/testing_database_bug_solution_1.jpg"> 

:bulb: - Temporarily activating the sqlite3 Django backends database fixed the issue.

<img width="70%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/testing_database_bug_solution_2.jpg"> 

*After*

<img width="70%" alt="debugging" src="documentation_for_github_readme/testing_database_bug_solution_3.jpg"> 


## Deployment

The project is deployed to GitHub via Gitpod Terminal with an integrated VScode editor. Then it is connected to the Heroku app to be reached via a web browser for user convenience. To enable this, a special Code Institute template was cloned and used https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template .

The app is run in the backend terminal using **python3 manage.py runserver** and dependencies are placed in the requirements.txt file. The instruction on Heroku deployment was taken from the Code Institute Love Sandwiches walkthrough project, step by step as required.

### Creating the Heroku app

The project was deployed to Heroku as follows:

- Create an account and log in to https://www.heroku.com/
- Click 'New' from the dashboard, and from the drop-down menu select "Create new app"
- Make a unique app name: mom-data
- Choose a relevant geographical region, Europe
- Click "Create app"
- In the settings menu, go to "Config Vars" section
- Click "Reveal Config Vars", where dependencies are installed
- In "Deploy" tab, select Github as the deployment method
- Connect to GitHub
- Find the project repository and click "connect" next to it
- "Enable Automatic Deploys" for automatic deployment with every new change
